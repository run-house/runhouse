Python API
====================================
Runhouse offers a programmatic API in Python to manage your account and resources.


Resources
------------------------------------
Resources are the Runhouse abstraction for objects that can be saved, shared, and reused.
This includes both compute abstractions (clusters, functions, packages, environments) and
data abstractions (files, blobs, folders).

Compute Abstractions
------------------------------------
The Function, Cluster, Env, Package, and Module APIs allow a seamless flow of code and execution across local and remote compute.
They blur the line between program execution and deployment, providing both a path of least resistence for running
a sub-routine on specific hardware, while unceremoniously turning that sub-routine into a reusable service.
They also provide convenient dependency isolation and management, provider-agnostic provisioning and termination,
and rich debugging and accessibility interfaces built-in.

Data Abstractions
------------------------------------
The Folder, Blob, and File APIs provide a simple interface for storing, recalling, and moving data between
the user's laptop, remote compute, cloud storage, and specialized storage (e.g. data warehouses).
They provide least-common-denominator APIs across providers, allowing users to easily specify the actions
they want to take on the data without needed to dig into provider-specific APIs. We'd like to extend this
to other data concepts in the future, like kv-stores, time-series, vector and graph databases, etc.

Secrets
------------------------------------
Runhouse provides a convenient interface for managing your secrets in a secure manner.
Secrets are stored in `Vault <https://www.vaultproject.io/>`_, an industry standard for
secrets management, and never touches Runhouse servers. Please see
:ref:`Security and Metadata Collection` for more information on security.
