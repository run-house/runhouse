Security and Authentication
===========================
By default, Runhouse collects metadata from provisioned clusters and data relating to performance and error monitoring.
This data will only be used by Runhouse to improve the product.

Cluster Metadata Collection
---------------------------
We collect non-sensitive data on the cluster that helps us understand how Runhouse is being used. This data includes:

- Python version
- Resources (cpus, gpus, memory)
- Cloud provider
- Region
- Instance type


Performance & Error Monitoring
------------------------------------
We collect data from normal package usage that helps us understand the performance and errors that are raised.
This data is collected and sent to `Sentry <https://sentry.io/>`_, a third-party error tracking service.

Removing Collected Data
------------------------------------
If you would like us to remove your collected data, please contact
the `Runhouse team <https://www.run.house/about>`__ (first name at run.house)

Disabling Data Collection
-----------------------------------
To disable data collection and error tracking collection, set the environment variable :code:`DISABLE_DATA_COLLECTION`
to :code:`True`. Alternatively, set :code:`disable_data_collection` to :code:`true` in your
local Runhouse config (:code:`~/.rh/config.yaml`), or in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    import runhouse as rh
    rh.configs.disable_data_collection()
