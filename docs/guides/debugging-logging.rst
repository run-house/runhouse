Debugging and Logging
=====================

Below, we describe how to access log outputs and show a sample debugging flow. We are still currently
working on making logs more accessible and improving the debugging flow.


Logging
~~~~~~~

There are two main ways to access logs.

Logs are automatically output onto the cluster, in the file ``~/.rh/cluster_server_<cluster_name>.log``.
You can ssh into the cluster with ``ssh cluster-name`` to access these logs.

Alternatively, to see logs on your local machine while running a remote function, you can add the
``stream_logs=True`` argument to your function call.

.. code:: ipython3

    remote_fn = rh.function(fn)
    fn(fn_args, stream_logs=True)


Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

For general debugging that doesn't occur within remote function calls, you can add
``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`` whereever you want to set your debugging session.
If the code is being run locally at the point of the debugger, you'll be able to access the session from your
local machine. If the code is being run remotely on a cluster, you will need to ssh into the cluster with
``ssh cluster-name``, and then run ``screen -r`` inside the cluster. From there, you will see the RPC logs
being printed out, and can debug normally inside the ``screen``.

.. note::

    When debugging inside ``screen``, please use ``Ctrl A+D`` to exit out of the screen. Do NOT use ``Ctrl C``,
    which will terminate the RPC server.

    If you accidentally terminate the RPC server, you can run ``cluster.restart_server()`` to restart the
    server.

For debugging remote functions, which are launched using ``ray``, we can utilize Ray's debugger. Add a
``breakpoint()`` call inside the function where you want to start the debugging session, then ssh into the
cluster with ``ssh cluster-name``, and call ``ray debug`` to view select the breakpoint to enter. You can run
normal ``pdb`` commands within the debugging session, and can refer to
`Ray Debugger <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-contribute/debugging.html>`__ for more information.
