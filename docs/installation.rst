Installation and Setup
======================

An overview of common installation and setup steps when working with Runhouse.

- Installing the Runhouse library
- Cloud providers and credentials
- Cluster lifecycle management
- Authenticate with Runhouse Den

Install the Runhouse library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optionally, begin by setting up a virtual env with `Conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_
or your package and environment management tool of choice. This allows you to maintain an environment with a
specific version of Python and installed packages.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ conda create -n rh_env python=3.9.15
    $ conda activate rh_env

For local-only development, the Runhouse base package can be installed with:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install runhouse

**Recommended**: To use Runhouse to launch on-demand clusters, please instead run the following command.
This additionally installs SkyPilot, which is used for launching fresh VMs through your cloud provider.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install "runhouse[sky]"

Alternatively, if you plan to use Runhouse with a specific cloud provider, you can install the package with
that provider's CLI included - or choose multiple providers. SkyPilot will also be included with these.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Cloud-specific installation
    $ pip install "runhouse[aws]"
    # Include multiple providers
    $ pip install "runhouse[aws,gcp]"


Configure Cloud Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optionally, for `on-demand clusters </docs/tutorials/api-clusters#on-demand-clusters>`_, Runhouse uses
`SkyPilot <https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot>`_ to launch and manage virtual machine instances on your cloud providers.
These steps are not necessary when using static clusters that can be accessed with SSH credentials.

For each provider, we recommend you begin by checking your configuration with SkyPilot.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sky check

This will show a detailed status of which cloud providers have already been configured properly.

AWS
---

Start by installing the AWS CLI. Follow this
`Getting Started <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html>`_ guide
or use ``pip install "runhouse[aws]"`` to include it with the Runhouse library.

Next, configure AWS with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ aws configure

You'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access ID. This can be found by logging into
the `AWS Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home>`_. Click on the name
of your account in the top-left corner of the screen and then select
"Securtiy credentials" from the dropdown.

To verify that credentials are properly set up, run the SkyPilot command again:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sky check

For more info: `SkyPilot AWS <https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloud-setup/cloud-permissions/aws.html>`_

GCP
---

Begin by installing Runhouse with GCP:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install "runhouse[gcp]"

Additionally, you'll need to install GCP tools. Run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install google-api-python-client
    $ conda install -c conda-forge google-cloud-sdk -y

Your GCP credentials may also need to be set:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ gcloud init
    # Run this if you don't have a credentials file.
    $ gcloud auth application-default login
    $ sky check


You'll be prompted to pick a cloud project to use after running ``gcloud init``.
If you don't have one ready yet, you can connect one later by listing your projects
with ``gcloud projects list`` and setting one
with ``gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>``.

For more info: `SkyPilot GCP <https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#google-cloud-platform-gcp>`_

Azure
-----

If you have an Azure account, use the following commands to install Runhouse and configure your
credentials to launch instances on their cloud.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install "runhouse[azure]"
    # Login
    $ az login
    # Set the subscription to use
    $ az account set -s <subscription_id>
    $ sky check

For more info: `SkyPilot Azure <https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#azure>`_


Other Providers
---------------

For a full list of providers and configuration details: `SkyPilot documentation <https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#cloud-account-setup>`_.
Some additional providers supported by Runhouse via SkyPilot include:

- Kubernetes
- Lambda Cloud
- & more

On-Demand Cluster Lifecycle Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that you have full control over the availability of on-demand clusters, and the cost associated with maintaining them,
you may find the following `SkyPilot commands <https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cli.html#cluster-cli>`_ helpful:

- ``sky status`` - Displays a list of all your clusters by name.
- ``sky stop <NAME>`` - Stops an instance. This will not fully tear down the cluster in case you need to restart it.
- ``sky down <NAME>`` - Fully tears down the instance. Best for when you are done using a cluster entirely.
- ``ssh <NAME>`` - Easily SSH into your cluster. Here you can further examine Runhouse's server with ``runhouse status``.

Example output from ``sky status``:

.. parsed-literal::
    :class: code-output

    Clusters

    Managed jobs
    No in-progress managed jobs. (See: sky jobs -h)

    Services
    No live services. (See: sky serve -h)


Authenticate with Runhouse Den
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable sharing features through Runhouse Den, you can log in to your
Runhouse Den account. Start by creating one via our `signup page <https://www.run.house/signup>`_.
You'll have the option to authenticate with your Google or Github account.

Once you've created an account, you'll be able to access your Runhouse token on your `account page <https://www.run.house//account>`_.

Login to Runhouse in your terminal with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ runhouse login

You'll be prompted to enter your token and, after your initial login, you will see the following propmts:

- ``Download your Runhouse config to your local .rh folder? [Y/n]:`` - Updates your local config file from your settings on the cloud
- ``Upload your local .rh config to Runhouse? [y/N]:`` - Use updates to your local config to modify your saved account settings

If you are running Runhouse strictly in code (like in a notebook), you can also login to your account with the Python API:

.. code-block:: python

    import runhouse as rh
    rh.login()
