# # Deploy a LangChain RAG as a service on AWS EC2

# This is an example of easily deploying [LangChain's Quickstart RAG app](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/quickstart)
# as a service on AWS EC2 using Runhouse.

# ## Setup credentials and dependencies

# Optionally, set up a virtual environment:
# ```shell
# $ conda create -n langchain-rag python=3.9.15
# $ conda activate langchain-rag
# ```
# Install Runhouse, the only library needed to run this script locally:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]"
# ```

# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to
# make sure our AWS credentials are set up:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```

# We'll be hitting OpenAI's API, so we need to set up our OpenAI API key:
# ```shell
# $ export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openai key>
# ```
#
# ## Setting up a class for your app
#
# We import `runhouse`, because that's all that's needed to run the script locally.
# The actual torch and transformers imports can happen within the functions
# that will be sent to the Runhouse cluster; we don't need those locally.
from typing import List

import runhouse as rh

# Next, we define a class that will hold the LangChain app and allow us to send requests to it.
# You'll notice this class inherits from `rh.Module`.
# This is a Runhouse class that allows you to
# run code in your class on a remote machine.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on functions and modules](/docs/tutorials/api-modules).

# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `CPU:2`, which is the accelerator type and count that we need. In this
# case, it is a simple CPU cluster. We could alternatively specify a specific AWS instance type,
# such as `p3.2xlarge` or `g4dn.xlarge`.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on clusters](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that your code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely.
# :::
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Note: Runhouse also supports custom domains secured automatically with HTTPS so you can use your own domain name
    # when sharing an endpoint. Check out our docs on [using custom domains](https://www.run.house/docs/main/en/api/python/cluster#using-a-custom-domain)
    # for more information.
    cluster = rh.cluster(
        name="rh-serving-cpu",
        instance_type="CPU:2",
        provider="aws",
        server_connection_type="tls",
        open_ports=[443],
    ).up_if_not()

    # Next, we define the environment for our module. This includes the required dependencies that need
    # to be installed on the remote machine, as well as any secrets that need to be synced up from local to remote.
    # Passing `openai` to the `secrets` parameter will load the OpenAI API key we set up earlier.
    #
    # Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on envs](/docs/tutorials/api-envs).

    # Finally, we define our module and run it on the remote cluster. We construct it normally and then call
    # `get_or_to` to run it on the remote cluster. Using `get_or_to` allows us to load the exiting Module
    # by the name `basic_rag_app` if it was already put on the cluster. If we want to update the module each
    # time we run this script, we can use `to` instead of `get_or_to`.
    #
    # Note that we also pass the `env` object to the `get_or_to` method, which will ensure that the environment is
    # set up on the remote machine before the module is run.

    # ## Standing up an endpoint
    # We can call the model via an HTTP request, which calls directly into the module's `invoke` method:
    # ```python
    #   base_url = f"{rag_app.endpoint()}/invoke"
    #   encoded_prompt = urllib.parse.quote(user_input)
    #   resp = requests.get(f"{base_url}?user_prompt={encoded_prompt}")
    #   print(resp.json())
    # ```

    # And we can also call it via cURL:
    # ```python
    # print(
    #     f"curl {base_url}?user_prompt={encoded_prompt} -X GET -d "
    #     "-H 'Content-Type: application/json'"
    # )
    # ```
