# # Deploy Llama 2 7B Model with TGI on AWS Inferentia2
# This example demonstrates how to deploy Llama 2 7B with
# [TGI](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/text-generation-inference) on AWS Inferentia2
# using Runhouse, specifically with the [AWS Neuron SDK](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).
# It will launch and set up the hardware, deploy the TGI container, and show multiple ways to run inference with
# the model, including the Messages API and OpenAI client.
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]"
# ```
#
# We'll be using [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/aws-neuron/Llama-2-7b-hf-neuron-budget), which is a gated
# model and requires a Hugging Face token in order to access it.
#
# To set up your Hugging Face token, run the following command in your local terminal:
# ```shell
# $ export HF_TOKEN=<your huggingface token>
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to make
# sure our AWS credentials are set up with SkyPilot:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```
#
# ## Setting up a model class
import time
from pathlib import Path

import requests

# We import runhouse, the only required library to have installed locally:
import runhouse as rh


# Next, we define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# You'll notice this class inherits from `rh.Module`.
# This is a Runhouse class that allows you to
# run code in your class on a remote machine.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on functions and modules](/docs/tutorials/api-modules).

# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `inf2.8xlarge`, which is
# an [AWS inferentia instance type on EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/).
#
# We also open port 8080, which is the port that the TGI model will be running on.
#
# We use a specific `image_id`, which in this case is the
# [Deep Learning AMI Base Neuron](https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/aws-deep-learning-ami-base-neuron-ubuntu-20-04/)
# which comes with the AWS Neuron drivers preinstalled. The image_id is region-specific. To change the region,
# use the AWS CLI command on the page above under "Query AMI-ID with AWSCLI."
# Learn more about clusters in the [Runhouse docs](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that your code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely.
# :::
if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = 8080

    # We define the image for our module. This includes the required dependencies that need
    # to be installed on the remote machine, as well as any secrets that need to be synced up from local to remote.
    #
    # Passing `huggingface` to the `sync_secrets` method will load the Hugging Face token we set up earlier. This is
    # needed to download the model from the Hugging Face model hub. Runhouse will handle saving the token down
    # on the cluster in the default Hugging Face token location (`~/.cache/huggingface/token`).
    img = (
        rh.Image(name="tgi", image_id="ami-0e0f965ee5cfbf89b")
        .install_packages(["docker"])
        .sync_secrets(["huggingface"])
    )

    # Launch an 8xlarge AWS Inferentia2 instance
    cluster = rh.cluster(
        name="rh-inf2-8xlarge",
        instance_type="inf2.8xlarge",
        region="us-east-1",
        disk_size=512,
        provider="aws",

        open_ports=[port],
    ).up_if_not()

    # We can run commands directly on the cluster via `cluster.run_bash()`. Here, we set up the environment for our
    # upcoming environment (more on that below) that installed some AWS-neuron specific libraries.
    # We install the `transformers-neuronx` library before restarting the Runhouse cluster (not affecting the underlying infra) to avoid
    # [common errors](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/frameworks/torch/torch-neuronx/training-troubleshooting.html):

    # Finally, we define our module and run it on the remote cluster. We construct it normally and then call
    # `get_or_to` to run it on the remote cluster. Using `get_or_to` allows us to load the exiting Module
    # by the name `tgi_inference` if it was already put on the cluster. If we want to update the module each
    # time we run this script, we can use `to` instead of `get_or_to`.
    remote_tgi_model = TGIInference().get_or_to(cluster, name="tgi-inference")

    # ## Sharing an inference endpoint
    # We can publish this module for others to use:
    # ```python
    # remote_tgi_model.share(visibility="public")
    # ```

    # Alternatively we can share with specific users:
    # ```python
    # remote_tgi_model.share(["user1@gmail.com", "user2@gmail.com"], access_level="read")
    # ```

    # Note: For more info on fine-grained access controls, see the
    # [Runhouse docs on sharing](https://www.run.house/docs/tutorials/quick-start-den#sharing).

    # ## Deploying the model
    # We can call the `deploy` method on the model class instance if it were running locally.
    # This will load and run the model on the remote cluster.
    # We only need to do this setup step once, as further calls will use the existing docker container deployed
    # on the cluster and maintain state between calls:
    remote_tgi_model.deploy()

    # ## Sending a prompt to the model
    prompt_message = "What is Deep Learning?"

    # We'll use the Messages API to send the prompt to the model.
    # See [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/messages_api#streaming) for more info
    # on using the Messages API

    # Call the model with the prompt messages:
    # Note: We can also update some of the [default parameters](https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference/#/Text%20Generation%20Inference/generate)

    # For streaming results, use the `/generate_stream` endpoint and iterate over the results:
    # ```python
    # for message in resp:
    #    print(message)
    # ```

    # Alternatively, we can also call the model via HTTP
    # Note: We can also use a streaming route by replacing `generate` with `generate_stream`:
