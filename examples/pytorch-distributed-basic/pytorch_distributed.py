# # PyTorch Multi-node Distributed Training
# A basic example showing how to use Runhouse to Pythonically run a PyTorch distributed training script on a
# cluster of GPUs. Often distributed training is launched from multiple parallel CLI commands
# (`python -m torch.distributed.launch ...`), each spawning separate training processes (ranks).
# Here, we're creating each process as a separate worker on the cluster, sending our training function
# into each worker, and calling the replicas concurrently to trigger coordinated multi-node training
# (`torch.distributed.init_process_group` causes each to wait for all to connect, and sets up the distributed
# communication). We're using two single-GPU instances (and therefore two ranks) for simplicity, but we've included
# the basic logic to handle multi-GPU nodes as well, where you'd add more worker processes per node and set `device_ids`
# accordingly.
#
# Despite it being common to use a launcher script to start distributed training, this approach is more flexible and
# allows for more complex orchestration, such as running multiple training jobs concurrently, handling exceptions,
# running distributed training alongside other tasks on the same cluster. It's also significantly easier to debug
# and monitor, as you can see the output of each rank in real-time and get stack traces if a worker fails.
