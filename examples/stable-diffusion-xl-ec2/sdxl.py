# # Deploy Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 on AWS EC2

# This example demonstrates how to deploy a
# [Stable Diffusion XL model from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)
# on AWS EC2 using Runhouse.
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
#
# Optionally, set up a virtual environment:
# ```shell
# $ conda create -n rh-sdxl python=3.9.15
# $ conda activate rh-sdxl
# ```
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]" Pillow
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to
# make sure our AWS credentials are set up:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```
# We'll be downloading the Stable Diffusion model from Hugging Face, so we need to set up our Hugging Face token:
# ```shell
# $ export HF_TOKEN=<your huggingface token>
# ```
#
# ## Setting up a model class
#
# We import runhouse and other required libraries:

import base64
import os
from io import BytesIO

import runhouse as rh
from PIL import Image

# Next, we define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# You'll notice this class inherits from `rh.Module`.
# This is a Runhouse class that allows you to
# run code in your class on a remote machine.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on functions and modules](/docs/tutorials/api-modules).

# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `g5.8xlarge`, which is an AWS instance type. We can alternatively specify
# an accelerator type and count, such as `A10G:1`, and any instance type with those specifications will be used.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on clusters](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that your code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely.
# :::
if __name__ == "__main__":

    cluster = rh.cluster(
        name="rh-g5",
        instance_type="g5.8xlarge",
        provider="aws",
    ).up_if_not()

    # Next, we define the environment for our module. This includes the required dependencies that need
    # to be installed on the remote machine, as well as any secrets that need to be synced up from local to remote.
    # Passing `huggingface` to the `secrets` parameter will load the Hugging Face token we set up earlier.
    #
    # Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on envs](/docs/tutorials/api-envs).
    env = rh.env(
        name="sdxl_inference",
        reqs=[
            "diffusers==0.21.4",
            "huggingface_hub",
            "torch",
            "transformers==4.31.0",
            "accelerate==0.21.0",
        ],
        secrets=["huggingface"],  # Needed to download model
        env_vars={"NEURON_RT_NUM_CORES": "2"},
    )

    # Finally, we define our module and run it on the remote cluster. We construct it normally and then call
    # `get_or_to` to run it on the remote cluster. Using `get_or_to` allows us to load the exiting Module
    # by the name `sdxl` if it was already put on the cluster. If we want to update the module each
    # time we run this script, we can use `to` instead of `get_or_to`.
    #
    # Note that we also pass the `env` object to the `get_or_to` method, which will ensure that the environment is
    # set up on the remote machine before the module is run.
    model = StableDiffusionXLPipeline().get_or_to(cluster, env=env, name="sdxl")

    # ## Calling our remote function
    #
    # We can call the `generate` method on the model class instance if it were running locally.
    # This will run the function on the remote cluster and return the response to our local machine automatically.
    # Further calls will also run on the remote machine, and maintain state that was updated between calls, like
    # `self.model`.
    prompt = "A woman runs through a large, grassy field towards a house."
    response = model.generate(
        prompt,
        num_inference_steps=25,
        negative_prompt="disfigured, ugly, deformed",
    )

    for gen_img in response:
        img = decode_base64_image(gen_img)
        img.show()
