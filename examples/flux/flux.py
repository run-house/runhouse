# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `g5.8xlarge`, which is an AWS instance type. We can alternatively specify
# an accelerator type and count, such as `A10G:1`, and any instance type with those specifications will be used.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on clusters](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that your code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely.

    # Finally, we define our module and run it on the remote cluster. We construct it normally and then call
    # `to` to run it on the remote cluster. Alternatively, we could first check for an existing instance on the cluster
    # by calling `cluster.get(name="flux")`. This would return the remote model after an initial run.

    #
    # We can call the `generate` method on the model class instance if it were running locally.
    # This will run the function on the remote cluster and return the response to our local machine automatically.
    # Further calls will also run on the remote machine, and maintain state that was updated between calls
