# # Deploy Mistral's 7B Model with TGI on AWS EC2

# This example demonstrates how to deploy a
# [TGI model](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/messages_api) on AWS EC2 using Runhouse.
# This example draws inspiration from
# [Huggingface's tutorial on AWS SageMaker](https://huggingface.co/blog/text-generation-inference-on-inferentia2).
# Zephyr is a 7B fine-tuned version of [Mistral's 7B-v0.1 model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1).
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install openai "runhouse[aws]"
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to make
# sure our AWS credentials are set up:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```
#
# ## Setting up a model class
# We import runhouse and openai, the required libraries to have installed locally:

import time
from pathlib import Path

import runhouse as rh
from openai import OpenAI


# Next, we define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# You'll notice this class inherits from `rh.Module`.
# This is a Runhouse class that allows you to
# run code in your class on a remote machine.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on functions and modules](/docs/tutorials/api-modules).

# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `g5.4xlarge`, which is
# an [AWS instance type on EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/) with a GPU.
#
# For this model we'll need a GPU and at least 16GB of RAM
# We also open port 8080, which is the port that the TGI model will be running on.
#
# Learn more about clusters in the [Runhouse docs](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that your code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely.
# :::
if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = 8080
    # First, we define the compute and the image. This includes the required dependencies that need
    # to be installed on the remote machine, as well as any secrets that need to be synced up from local to remote.
    img = rh.Image(name="tgi_image").install_packages(
        ["docker", "openai", "torch", "transformers"]
    )

    cluster = rh.compute(
        name="rh-g5-4xlarge",
        instance_type="g5.4xlarge",
        provider="aws",
        image=img,
        open_ports=[port],
    ).up_if_not()

    cluster.sync_secrets(["huggingface"])

    # Finally, we define our module and run it on the remote cluster. We construct it normally and then call
    # `get_or_to` to run it on the remote cluster. Using `get_or_to` allows us to load the exiting Module
    # by the name `tgi_inference` if it was already put on the cluster. If we want to update the module each
    # time we run this script, we can use `to` instead of `get_or_to`.
    #
    # Note that we also pass the `env` object to the `get_or_to` method, which will ensure that the environment is
    # set up on the remote machine before the module is run.
    remote_tgi_model = TGIInference().get_or_to(cluster, name="tgi-inference")

    # ## Sharing an inference endpoint
    # We can publish this module for others to use:
    # ```python
    # remote_tgi_model.share(visibility="public")
    # ```

    # Alternatively we can share with specific users:
    # ```python
    # remote_tgi_model.share(["user1@gmail.com", "user2@gmail.com"], access_level="read")
    # ```

    # Note: For more info on fine-grained access controls, see the
    # [Runhouse docs on sharing](https://www.run.house/docs/tutorials/quick-start-den#sharing).

    # ## Deploying the model
    # We can call the `deploy` method on the model class instance if it were running locally.
    # This will load and run the model on the remote cluster.
    # We only need to do this setup step once, as further calls will use the existing docker container deployed
    # on the cluster and maintain state between calls:
    remote_tgi_model.deploy()

    # ## Sending a prompt to the model
    prompt_messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favourite condiment?"},
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount "
            "of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!",
        },
        {"role": "user", "content": "Do you have mayonnaise recipes?"},
    ]

    # We'll use the Messages API to send the prompt to the model.
    # See [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/messages_api#streaming) for more info
    # on the Messages API, and using the OpenAI python client

    # Initialize the OpenAI client, with the URL set to the cluster's address:
    base_url = f"http://{cluster.head_ip}:{port}/v1"
    client = OpenAI(base_url=base_url, api_key="-")

    # Call the model with the prompt messages:
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="tgi", messages=prompt_messages, stream=False
    )
    print(chat_completion)

    # For streaming results, set `stream=True` and iterate over the results:
    # ```python
    # for message in chat_completion:
    #    print(message)
    # ```

    # Alternatively, we can also call the model via HTTP:
    print(
        f"curl http://{cluster.head_ip}:{port}/v1/chat/completions -X POST -d '"
        '{"model": "tgi", "stream": false, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},'
        '{"role": "user", "content": "What is deep learning?"}]}'
        "' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'"
    )
