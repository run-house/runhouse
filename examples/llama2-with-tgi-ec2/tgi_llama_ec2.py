# # Deploy Llama 7B Model with TGI on AWS EC2

# This example demonstrates how to deploy a [Llama 7B model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)
# using Hugging Face [TGI](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/messages_api) on AWS EC2 using Runhouse.
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]"
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to make
# sure our AWS credentials are set up:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```
#
# ## Setting up a model class
# We import runhouse, the only required library to have installed locally:

import time
from pathlib import Path

import requests

import runhouse as rh

# Next, we define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# You'll notice this class inherits from `rh.Module`.
# This is a Runhouse class that allows you to
# run code in your class on a remote machine.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on functions and modules](/docs/tutorials/api-modules).

# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `g5.4xlarge`, which is
# an [AWS instance type on EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/) with a GPU.
#
# For this model we'll need a GPU and at least 16GB of RAM
# We also open port 8080, which is the port that the TGI model will be running on.
#
# Learn more about clusters in the [Runhouse docs](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that all the following code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely. We'll break up the block in this example to
# improve readability.
# :::
if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = 8080

    # First, we define the image for our module. This includes the required dependencies that need
    # to be installed on the remote machine, as well as any secrets that need to be synced up from local to remote.
    #
    # Passing `huggingface` to the `sync_secrets` method will load the Hugging Face token we set up earlier. This is
    # needed to download the model from the Hugging Face model hub. Runhouse will handle saving the token down
    # on the cluster in the default Hugging Face token location (`~/.cache/huggingface/token`).
    img = (
        rh.Image(name="tgi_env")
        .install_packages(["docker", "torch", "transformers"])
        .sync_secrets(["huggingface"])
    )

    cluster = rh.cluster(
        name="rh-g5-4xlarge",
        instance_type="g5.4xlarge",
        provider="aws",
        image=img,
        open_ports=[port],
    ).up_if_not()

    # Finally, we define our module and run it on the remote cluster. We construct it normally and then call
    # `get_or_to` to run it on the remote cluster. Using `get_or_to` allows us to load the exiting Module
    # by the name `tgi_inference` if it was already put on the cluster. If we want to update the module each
    # time we run this script, we can use `to` instead of `get_or_to`.
    remote_tgi_model = TGIInference().get_or_to(cluster, name="tgi-inference")

    # ## Sharing an inference endpoint
    # We can publish this module for others to use:
    # ```python
    # remote_tgi_model.share(visibility="public")
    # ```

    # Alternatively we can share with specific users:
    # ```python
    # remote_tgi_model.share(["user1@gmail.com", "user2@gmail.com"], access_level="read")
    # ```

    # Note: For more info on fine-grained access controls, see the
    # [Runhouse docs on sharing](https://www.run.house/docs/tutorials/quick-start-den#sharing).

    # ## Deploying the model
    # We can call the `deploy` method on the model class instance if it were running locally.
    # This will load and run the model on the remote cluster.
    # We only need to do this setup step once, as further calls will use the existing docker container deployed
    # on the cluster and maintain state between calls:
    remote_tgi_model.deploy()

    # ## Sending a prompt to the model
    prompt_message = "What is Deep Learning?"

    # We'll use the Messages API to send the prompt to the model.
    # See [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/messages_api#streaming) for more info
    # on the Messages API

    # Call the model with the prompt messages:
    # Note: We can also update some of the [default parameters](https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference/#/Text%20Generation%20Inference/generate)
    data = {
        "inputs": prompt_message,
        "parameters": {
            "max_new_tokens": 50,
            "temperature": 0.9,
            "top_p": 0.92,
            "do_sample": True,
            "repetition_penalty": 1.2,
            "frequency_penalty": 1.0,
        },
    }
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"http://{cluster.head_ip}:{port}/generate", headers=headers, json=data
    )
    print(response.json())

    # For streaming results, use the `/generate_stream` endpoint and iterate over the results:
    # ```python
    # for message in resp:
    #    print(message)
    # ```

    # Alternatively, we can also call the model via HTTP
    # Note: We can also use a streaming route by replacing `generate` with `generate_stream`:
    print(
        f"curl http://{cluster.head_ip}:{port}/generate -X POST -d '"
        f'{{"inputs":"{prompt_message}","parameters":{{"max_new_tokens":20}}}}'
        "' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'"
    )
