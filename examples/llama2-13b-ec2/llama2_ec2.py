# # Deploy Llama 2 13B Chat Model Inference on AWS EC2

# This example demonstrates how to deploy a
# [LLama 2 13B model from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)
# on AWS EC2 using Runhouse.
#
# Make sure to sign the waiver on the model page so that you can access it.
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
#
# Optionally, set up a virtual environment:
# ```shell
# $ conda create -n llama-demo-apps python=3.8
# $ conda activate llama-demo-apps
# ```
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]" torch
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to
# make sure our AWS credentials are set up:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```
# We'll be downloading the Llama 2 model from Hugging Face, so we need to set up our Hugging Face token:
# ```shell
# $ export HF_TOKEN=<your huggingface token>
# ```
#
# ## Setting up a model class
#
# We import `runhouse` and `torch`, because that's all that's needed to run the script locally.
# The actual transformers imports can happen within the functions
# that will be sent to the Runhouse cluster; we don't need those locally.

import runhouse as rh
import torch

# Next, we define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# You'll notice this class inherits from `rh.Module`.
# This is a Runhouse class that allows you to
# run code in your class on a remote machine.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on functions and modules](/docs/tutorials/api-modules).
class HFChatModel(rh.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", **model_kwargs):
        super().__init__()
        self.model_id, self.model_kwargs = model_id, model_kwargs

        )

            self.model_id, **self.model_kwargs
        )

            self.load_model()
        inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
        generated_ids = self.model.generate(
            **inputs, **default_inf_kwargs, streamer=TextStreamer(self.tokenizer)
        )
        return self.tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]


# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `A10G:1`, which is the accelerator type and count that we need. We could
# alternatively specify a specific AWS instance type, such as `p3.2xlarge` or `g4dn.xlarge`.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on clusters](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that your code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely.
# :::
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # We define the image for our module. This includes the required dependencies that need
    # to be installed on the remote machine, as well as any secrets that need to be synced up from local to remote.
    # Passing `huggingface` to the `sync_secrets` method will load the Hugging Face token we set up earlier.
    img = (
        rh.Image(name="llama2inference")
        .pip_install(
            [
                "torch",
                "transformers",
                "accelerate",
                "bitsandbytes",
                "safetensors>=0.3.1",
                "scipy",
            ]
        )

        image=img,
    ).up_if_not()

    # Finally, we define our module and run it on the remote cluster. We construct it normally and then call
    # `get_or_to` to run it on the remote cluster. Using `get_or_to` allows us to load the exiting Module
    # by the name `llama-13b-model` if it was already put on the cluster. If we want to update the module each
    # time we run this script, we can use `to` instead of `get_or_to`.

    remote_hf_chat_model = HFChatModel(
        model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf",

        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        device_map="auto",
    ).get_or_to(gpu_cluster, name="llama-13b-model")

    # ## Calling our remote function
    #
    # We can call the `predict` method on the model class instance if it were running locally.
    # This will run the function on the remote cluster and return the response to our local machine automatically.
    # Further calls will also run on the remote machine, and maintain state that was updated between calls, like
    # `self.model` and `self.tokenizer`.
    while True:
        prompt = input(
            "\n\n... Enter a prompt to chat with the model, and 'exit' to exit ...\n"
        )
        if prompt.lower() == "exit":
            break
