# # Deploy Llama 3 8B Chat Model Inference on AWS EC2

# This example demonstrates how to deploy a
# [LLama 3 8B model from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)
# on AWS EC2 using Runhouse.
#
# Make sure to sign the waiver on the model page so that you can access it.
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
#
# Optionally, set up a virtual environment:
# ```shell
# $ conda create -n llama3-rh python=3.9.15
# $ conda activate llama3-rh
# ```
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]" torch
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to
# make sure our AWS credentials are set up:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```
# We'll be downloading the Llama 3 model from Hugging Face, so we need to set up our Hugging Face token:
# ```shell
# $ export HF_TOKEN=<your huggingface token>
# ```
#
# ## Setting up a model class
#
# We import `runhouse` and `torch`, because that's all that's needed to run the script locally.
# The actual transformers imports can happen within the functions
# that will be sent to the Runhouse cluster; we don't need those locally.

import runhouse as rh
import torch

# Next, we define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# We'll later wrap this with `rh.cls`.
# This is a Runhouse class that allows you to
# run code in your class on a remote machine.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on functions and modules](/docs/tutorials/api-modules).

# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `A10G:1`, which is the accelerator type and count that we need. We could
# alternatively specify a specific AWS instance type, such as `p3.2xlarge` or `g4dn.xlarge`.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on clusters](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that your code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely.
# :::
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # First, we define the image for our module. This includes the required dependencies that need
    # to be installed on the remote machine, as well as any secrets that need to be synced up from local to remote.
    # Passing `huggingface` to the `sync_secrets` method will load the Hugging Face token we set up earlier.
    img = rh.Image(name="llama3inference").pip_install(
        [
            "torch",
            "transformers",
            "accelerate",
            "bitsandbytes",
            "safetensors>=0.3.1",
            "scipy",
        ]

    # Finally, we define our module and run it on the remote cluster. We construct it normally and then call
    # `to` to run it on the remote cluster. Alternatively, we could first check for an existing instance on the cluster
    # by calling `cluster.get(name="llama3-8b-model")`. This would return the remote model after an initial run.
    # If we want to update the module each time we run this script, we prefer to use `to`.

    remote_hf_chat_model = RemoteChatModel(
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, name="llama3-8b-model"
    )

    # ## Calling our remote function
    #
    # We can call the `predict` method on the model class instance if it were running locally.
    # This will run the function on the remote cluster and return the response to our local machine automatically.
    # Further calls will also run on the remote machine, and maintain state that was updated between calls, like
    # `self.pipeline`.
    while True:
        prompt = input(
            "\n\n... Enter a prompt to chat with the model, and 'exit' to exit ...\n"

        if prompt.lower().strip() == "exit":

        output = remote_hf_chat_model.predict(prompt)
