# # Embarrassingly parallel GPU Jobs: Batch Embeddings

# This example demonstrates how to use Runhouse primitives to embed a large number of websites in parallel.
# We use a [BGE large model from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) and load it via
# the `SentenceTransformer` class from the `huggingface` library.
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
#
# Optionally, set up a virtual environment:
# ```shell
# $ conda create -n parallel-embed python=3.9.15
# $ conda activate parallel-embed
# ```
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]" torch beautifulsoup4 tqdm
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to
# make sure our AWS credentials are set up:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```
#
# ## Some utility functions
#
# We import `runhouse` and other utility libraries; only the ones that are needed to run the script locally.
# Imports of libraries that are needed on the remote machine (in this case, the `huggingface` dependencies)
# can happen within the functions that will be sent to the Runhouse cluster.

    # First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
    # Our `instance_type` here is defined as `A10G:1`, which is the accelerator type and count we need We could
    # alternatively specify a specific AWS instance type, such as `p3.2xlarge` or `g4dn.xlarge`. However, we
    # provision `num_replicas` number of these instances. This gives us one Runhouse cluster that has
    # several separate GPU machines that it can access.
    #
    # This is one major advantage of Runhouse: you can use a multinode machine as if it were one opaque cluster,
    # and send things to it from your local machine. This is especially useful for embarrassingly parallel tasks
    # like this one. Note that it is also far easier to provision several A10G:1 machines as spot instances
    # than it is to provision a single A10G:4 machine, which is why we do it this way.
    #
    # Note that if the cluster was
    # already up (e.g. if we had run this script before), the code would just bring it up instead of creating a
    # new one, since we have given it a unique name `"rh-4xa10g"`.

    # embedding model in separate processes, because we have 4 GPUs. We can do this by creating 4 separate envs
    # and 4 separate modules, each sent to a separate env. We do this in a loop here, with a list of dependencies
    # that we need remotely to run the module.
    #
    # In this case, each `env` is also on a separate machine, but we could also provision an A10G:4 instance,
    # and send all 4 envs to the same machine. Each env runs within a separate process on the machine, so they
    # won't interfere with each other.
    #
    # Note that we send the `URLEmbedder` class to the cluster, and then can construct our modules using the
    # returned "remote class" instead of the normal local class. These instances are then actually constructed
    # on the cluster, and any methods called on these instances would run on the cluster.

    # a blocking network call to the server. This allows us to use `asyncio` logic locally to run all the functions
    # in parallel.
    #
    # We also pass `stream_logs=False`, which means we won't get the stdout/stderr of the remote
    # function on our local machine. In this case, we're running a large batch job, and don't want to slow down
    # our work by spamming our local machine with logs.
