# # RAG App with Vector Embedding and LLM Generation
#
# This example defines a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) app that references text from websites
# to enrich the response from an LLM. Depending on the URLs you use to populate the vector database,
# you'll be able to answer questions more intelligently with relevant context.
#
# You could, for example, pass in the URL of a new startup and then ask the app to answer questions
# about that startup using information on their site. Or pass in several specialized gardening websites and
# ask nuanced questions about horticulture.
#
# ## Example Overview
# Deploy a FastAPI app that is able to create and store embeddings from text on public website URLs,
# and generate answers to questions using related context from stored websites and an open source LLM.
#
# #### Indexing:
# - **Send a list of URL paths** to the application via a POST endpoint
# - Use [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)
#   to **parse text from URLs**
# - **Create vector embeddings from split text** with [Sentence Transformers (SBERT)](https://sbert.net/index.html)
# - Store embeddings in a **vector database** ([LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/))
#
# #### Retrieval and generation:
# - **Send question text** via a GET endpoint on the FastAPI application
# - Create a vector embedding from the text and **retrieve related docs** from database
# - **Construct an LLM prompt** from documents and original question
# - Generate a response using an **LLM (Llama 3)**
# - **Output response** with source URLs and question input
#
# ![Graphic displaying the steps of indexing data and the retrieval and generation process](https://runhouse-tutorials.s3.amazonaws.com/indexing-retrieval-generation.png)
#
# Note: Some of the steps in this example could also be accomplished with platforms like OpenAI and
# tools such as LangChain, but we break out the components explicitly to fully illustrate each step and make the
# example easily adaptible to other use cases. Swap out components as you see fit!
#
# ### What does Runhouse enable?
# Runhouse allows you to turn complex operations such as preprocessing and inference into independent services.
# Servicifying with Runhouse enables:
# - **Decoupling**: AI/ML or compute-heavy heavy tasks can be separated from your main application.
#   This keeps the FastAPI app light and allows each service to scale independently.
# - **Multi-cloud**: Host Runhouse modules on remote machines from any cloud provider (even on the same GPU).
#   Take advantage of unused cloud credits and avoid platform dependence.
# - **Sharing**: Running on GPUs can be expensive, especially if they aren't fully utilized. By sharing services within
#   your organization, you can substantially cut costs.
#
# ### Why FastAPI?
# We chose FastAPI as our platform because of its popularity and simplicity. However, we could
# easily use any other *Python-based* platform with Runhouse. Streamlit, Flask, `<your_favorite>`, we got you!
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
#
# To ensure that Runhouse is able to manage deploying services to your cloud provider (AWS in this case)
# you may need to follow initial setup steps. Please visit the AWS section of
# our [Installation Guide](https://www.run.house/docs/installation)
#
# Additionally, we'll be downloading the Llama 3 model from Hugging Face, so we need to set up our Hugging Face token:
# ```shell
# $ export HF_TOKEN=<your huggingface token>
# ```
#
# Make sure to sign the waiver on the [Hugging Face model page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)
# so that you can access it.
#
# ## FastAPI RAG App Setup
# First, we'll import necessary packages and initialize variables used in the application. The `URLEmbedder` and
# `LlamaModel` classes that will be sent to Runhouse are available in the `app/modules` folder in this source code.

# ## Run the FastAPI App Locally
# Use the following command to run the app from your terminal:
#
# ```shell
# $ fastapi run app/main.py
# ```
#
# After a few minutes, you can navigate to `http://127.0.0.1/health` to check that your application is running.
# This may take a while due to initialization logic in the lifespan.
#
# You'll see something like:
# ```json
# { "status": "healthy" }
# ```
#
# To debug the application, you may prefer running `fastapi dev`. This will trigger
# automatic re-deployments from any changes to your code. Be sure to set `DEBUG` to `True` to
# override instances of the embedding and LLM services with updated versions.
#
# ### Example cURL Command to Add Embeddings
# To populate the LanceDB database with vector embeddings for use in the RAG app, you can send a HTTP request
# to the `/embeddings` POST endpoint. Let's say you have a question about bears. You could send a cURL
# command with a list of URLs including essential bear information:
#
# ```shell
# curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
#   --request POST \
#   --data '{"paths":["https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_the_Gummi_Bears"]}' \
#   http://127.0.0.1:8000/embeddings
# ```
#
# Alternatively, we recommend a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test HTTP APIs.
#
# ### Test the Generation Endpoint
# Open your browser and send a prompt to your locally running RAG app by appending your question
# to the URL as a query param, e.g. `?text=Does%20yellowstone%20have%20gummi%20bears%3F`
#
# ```text
# "http://127.0.0.1/generate?text=Does%20yellowstone%20have%20gummi%20bears%3F"
# ```
#
# The `LlamaModel` will need to load on the initial call and may take a few minutes to generate a
# response. Subsequent calls will generally take less than a second.
#
# Example output:
#
# ```json
# {
#   "question": "Does yellowstone have gummi bears?",
#   "response": [
#     " No, Yellowstone is bear country, not gummi bear country. Thanks for asking! "
#   ],
#   "sources": [
#     "https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm",
#     "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_the_Gummi_Bears"
#   ]
# }
# ```
#
# ## Deploying to Production
# There are any methods to deploy a FastAPI application to a production environment. With some modifications
# to the logic of the app, setting `DEBUG` to `False`, and deploying to a public IP, this example
# could easily serve as the backend to a RAG app.
#
# We won't go into depth on a specific method, but here are a few things to consider:
# - **Cloud credentials**: Runhouse uses [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) to provision remote
#   machines on various cloud providers. You'll need to ensure that you have the appropriate permissions available
#   on your production environment.
# - **ENV Variables**: This example passes your Hugging Face token via `sync_secrets` to grant permissions to use
#   Llama 3. Make sure you handle this on your server as well.
# - **Cluster lifecycle**: Running GPUs can be costly. `sky` commands make it easy to manage remote clusters locally
#   but you may also want to monitor your cloud provider to avoid unused GPUs running up a bill.
#
# If you're running into any problems using Runhouse in production, please reach out to our team at
# [team@run.house](mailto:team@run.house). We'd be happy to set up a time to help you debug live.
# Additionally, you can chat with us directly on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RnhB6589Hs).
