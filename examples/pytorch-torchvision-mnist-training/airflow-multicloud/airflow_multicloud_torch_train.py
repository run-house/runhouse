# # Using Multi-Cloud with Airflow

# This basic Airflow example combines CPU processing on AWS, storage on S3, and GPU processing on Google Cloud.
# There are several reasons why you might want to use multiple clouds in a single workflow:
# * Your data lives on AWS, but you are quota limited on GPUs there or don't have access to powerful GPUs. You can do pre-processing on AWS and then train on a second cloud where you have GPUs.
# * You don't want GPUs to sit idle while you are doing pre-processing or post-processing. You can use a GPU cluster on-demand and then down it when you are done.
# * You want to right-size instances for each step of execution rather than bringing up a box that is the maximum of each of your memory, CPU, and GPU requirements.

# The Torch model is identical to our [Torch training example](https://www.run.house/examples/torch-vision-mnist-basic-model-train-test).
#
# ## The usage pattern for Runhouse with Airflow:
# * Write Python classes and functions using normal, ordinary coding best practices. Do not think about DAGs or DSLs at all, just write great code.
# * Send the code for remote execution with Runhouse, and figure out whether the code works, debugging it interactively. Runhouse lets you send the code in seconds, and streams logs back. You can work on remote as if it were local.
# * Once you are satisfied with your code, you can write the callables for an Airflow PythonOperator. The code that is actually in the Airflow DAG is the **minimal code** to call out to already working Classes and Functions, defining the order of the steps (or you can even have a one-step Airflow DAG, making Airflow purely for scheduling and observability)
# * And you can easily iterate further on your code, or test the pipeline end-to-end from local with no Airflow participation

# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
#
# Optionally, set up a virtual environment:
# ```shell
# $ conda create -n demo-runhouse python=3.10
# $ conda activate demo-runhouse
# ```
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]" torch torchvision airflow
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS EC2 GCP instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we need to
# make sure our AWS credentials are set up:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ gcloud init
# $ gcloud auth application-default login
# $ sky check
# ```
#

# Import some other libraries we need - namely Airflow, Runhouse, and a few others.
