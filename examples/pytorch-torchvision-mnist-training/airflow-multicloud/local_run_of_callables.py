# You can easily test both the Airflow flow, and the underlying components and code by calling them from local

# Because the execution has been offloaded to GPU compute on remote, you can call each step from local, or from a notebook
# You can imagine that a DS or MLE might write a pipeline and interactively debug from local.
# Then, only when they are confident all the functions work, do they upload the Airflow pipeline which is minimal

# Airflow is used to schedule, monitor, and retry jobs while providing observability over runs.
# However, the code that is the substance of the program is not packed into the Airflow DAG.
