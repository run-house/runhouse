# # Deploy Mistral's 7B Model on AWS Inferentia

# This example demonstrates how to deploy a
# [Mitral 7B Model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) on AWS Inferentia using Runhouse.
#
# ## Setup credentials and dependencies
# Install the required dependencies:
# ```shell
# $ pip install "runhouse[aws]"
# ```
#
# We'll be launching an AWS Inferentia instance via [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot), so we
# need to make sure our AWS credentials are set up with SkyPilot:
# ```shell
# $ aws configure
# $ sky check
# ```
#
# ## Setting up a model class

# We import runhouse, the only required library to have installed locally:
import runhouse as rh

# Next, we define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# You'll notice this class inherits from `rh.Module`.
# This is a Runhouse class that allows you to
# run code in your class on a remote machine.
#
# Learn more in the [Runhouse docs on functions and modules](/docs/tutorials/api-modules).

# ## Setting up Runhouse primitives
#
# Now, we define the main function that will run locally when we run this script, and set up
# our Runhouse module on a remote cluster. First, we create a cluster with the desired instance type and provider.
# Our `instance_type` here is defined as `inf2.8xlarge`, which is
# an [AWS instance type on Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/).
#
# We use a specific `image_id`, which in this case is the
# [Deep Learning AMI Base Neuron](https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/aws-deep-learning-ami-base-neuron-ubuntu-20-04/)
# which comes with the AWS Neuron drivers preinstalled. The image_id is region-specific. To change the region,
# use the AWS CLI command on the page above under "Query AMI-ID with AWSCLI."
# Learn more about clusters in the [Runhouse docs](/docs/tutorials/api-clusters).
#
# :::note{.info title="Note"}
# Make sure that your code runs within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, as shown below. Otherwise,
# the script code will run when Runhouse attempts to run code remotely.
# :::
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cluster = rh.cluster(
        name="rh-inf2-8xlarge",
        instance_type="inf2.8xlarge",
        image_id="ami-0e0f965ee5cfbf89b",
        region="us-east-1",
        disk_size=512,
        provider="aws",
    ).up_if_not()

    # We can run commands directly on the cluster via `cluster.run()`. Here, we set up the environment for our
    # upcoming environment (more on that below) that installed some AWS-neuron specific libraries.
    # We install the `transformers-neuronx` library before the env is set up in order to avoid
    # [common errors](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/frameworks/torch/torch-neuronx/training-troubleshooting.html):

    # by the name `mistral-instruct` if it was already put on the cluster. If we want to update the module each
    # time we run this script, we can use `to` instead of `get_or_to`.
    #

    # set up on the remote machine before the module is run.

    # ## Loading and prompting the model
    # We can call the `generate` method on the model class instance if it were running locally.
    # This will load the tokenizer and model on the remote cluster.
    # We only need to do this setup step once, as further calls will use the existing model on the cluster and
    # maintain state between calls:
