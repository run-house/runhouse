# 📦Kubetorch🔥

**A Fast, Pythonic, "Serverless" Interface for Running ML Workloads on Kubernetes**

Kubetorch lets you programmatically build, iterate, and deploy ML applications on Kubernetes at any scale - directly from Python.

It brings your cluster's compute power into your local development environment, enabling extremely fast iteration (1-2 seconds). Logs, exceptions, and hardware faults are automatically propagated back to you in real-time.

Since Kubetorch has no local runtime or code serialization, you can access large-scale cluster compute from any Python environment - your IDE, notebooks, CI pipelines, or production code - just like you would use a local process pool.

## Hello World

```python
import kubetorch as kt

def simulate_workload(num_iterations: int = 5, vector_size: int = 10000):
    import numpy as np

    return sum(np.dot(np.random.rand(vector_size), np.random.rand(vector_size)) for _ in range(num_iterations))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define your compute - use a python:3.12-slim image and install numpy
    image = kt.images.Python312().pip_install(["numpy"])
    compute = kt.Compute(cpus=1, image=image)

    # Send local function to freshly launched remote compute
    remote_fn = kt.fn(simulate_workload).to(compute)

    # Runs remotely on your Kubernetes cluster
    result = remote_fn()
    print(result)
```

## What Kubetorch Enables

- **100x faster iteration** from 10+ minutes to 1-3 seconds for complex ML applications like RL and distributed training
- **50%+ compute cost savings** through intelligent resource allocation, bin-packing, and dynamic scaling
- **95% fewer production faults** with built-in fault handling with programmatic error recovery and resource adjustment

## Installation

### 1. Python Client

```bash
pip install "kubetorch[client]"
```

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment (Helm)

```bash
# Option 1: Install directly from OCI registry
helm upgrade --install kubetorch oci://ghcr.io/run-house/charts/kubetorch \
  --version 0.5.0 -n kubetorch --create-namespace

# Option 2: Download chart locally first
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/run-house/charts/kubetorch --version 0.5.0 --untar
helm upgrade --install kubetorch ./kubetorch -n kubetorch --create-namespace
```

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Installation Guide](https://www.run.house/kubetorch/installation).

## Source Layout

This repo now includes the customer-facing OSS deployment components that were previously split across internal and OSS repos:

- `python_client/` for the SDK
- `charts/kubetorch/` for the Helm chart
- `services/` for the controller and data store sources
- `release/default_images/` for the workload base images
- `release/` for release scripts and version sync
